          MindChat is a safe and inclusive platform where people can talk about things that are on their mind. Whether they underwent a traumatic event or just want to confide to someone, they can talk to therapists. Mental health is an important aspect of overall wellbeing, and many people tend to ignore mental health issues due to a variety of reasons, which this eventually makes the problem worse. They are reluctant to reach out for help when they need it. In fact, 1 in every 5 people live with mental illness. With MindChat, you can regain control of your mind and get the peace you're looking for.

        <p class="lead">MindChat allows you to talk therapists in a confidential manner. Once you go to the Connect tab, you can input your name and pick a username of your preference. This username will not reveal your original identity. Then you can choose which room you want to head to and discuss issues with therapists. For example, if you want to speak out about certain problems you are facing, you can click on the "Speak Out" room and you can chat with the therapist online.
