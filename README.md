### Description

When users arrive to our platform, they can immediately start chatting with therapists. There is no hassle in creating an account, etc. They can go to the Connect Tab where they will input their name and choose a username. Then they can pick which room they want to go to and chat with the therapist there. Their identity and data will remain confidential, which is important in protecting user's privacy.
